    <div introduction>
        <p>Orientalism, Islamophobia and even thinly disguised racism: the media’s treatment of Islam is criticised daily by social agents from across the ideological spectrum.</p>

        <p>From the culturalist assumptions brought to light by <idlmRef [ref]="'Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World'" [text]="'Edward Saïd'"></idlmRef>&nbsp;(1981) to the analysis of the “manufacturing” of a “Muslim problem” dissected by <idlmRef [ref]="'T. Deltombe, L\'islam imaginaire, La Découverte, Paris, 2005'" [text]="'Thomas Deltombe'"></idlmRef>&nbsp;, <idlmRef [placement]="'right'" [ref]="'A.Hajjat, M.Mohammed, Islamophobie. Comment les élites françaises fabriquent le “problème musulman”, Paris, La Découverte, coll. « Cahiers libres », 2013'" [text]="'Abdellali Hajjat et Marwan Mohammed'"></idlmRef>&nbsp;, sociological criticism tends to reveal a poor understanding of the religious, political and socio-cultural phenomena directly or indirectly linked to Islam. Essentialist interpretations and the culturalisation of problems that are mainly social, economic and political form part of the processes deconstructed by this critical approach.</p>

        <p>In response to this sociological assessment, another criticism – seldom academic but no less visible – reproaches the press for Islamophilic leanings. Denouncing a “self-righteouseness” that is particularly friendly towards Islam and even conceals the truth about actors complicit in the “Islamist cause”, its promoters call for censorship and self-censorship to be lifted when it comes to facts involving Islam or Muslim individuals.</p>

        <p>The analysis of the terms, their appearance and the framework supporting them highlights what <idlmRef [ref]="'I. Riocreux, La langue des Médias, destruction du langage et fabrication du consentement, L’artilleur, Editions du Toucan, 2016'" [text]="'Ingrid Riocreux'"></idlmRef>&nbsp;calls the “prescriptive power of journalistic speech” (2016). In this regard, the French press provides a fertile field in which to examine the terms of a debate, an issue or problem that, though it evolves over time, is inexorably imposed as a constant in the French media landscape.</p>

        <p>In this context, this study focuses on the three “big” French dailies: Le Monde, Le Figaro and Libération. Identifying the appearance of the terms “Islam” and “Muslim” in a relatively recent period (1997-2015), the study methods provide an innovative and particularly revealing view of the issue of the media’s treatment of Islam. Through its quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study therefore allows us to observe the events around which the terms arise, to analyse the framework and the orientation of the debates that raise them and, finally, to take an overall evolving view of this media treatment.</p>

        <p>“To name, we know, is to show, to create, to bring into existence” <idlmRef [ref]="'P. Bourdieu, On Television, 1996'" [text]="'(P. Bourdieu)'"></idlmRef>. Behind the press’ words the terms that define the context in which this ideological confrontation is written may be found, if not the reasons for it. This study, therefore, following <idlmRef [ref]="'T. Deltombe, L\'islam imaginaire, La Découverte, Paris, 2005'" [text]="'Thomas Deltombe'"></idlmRef>, attempts “to erase received ideas to see which new ideas have been given to us”, because words refer to particular universes, contain a history and shape our relationship with the world and with others.</p><br>

        <p>
            The outbreak around the turn of the 21st century of an international form of violent extremism claiming to act in the name of Islam placed the religion and its followers in the media spotlight in European societies. In the wake of the  <idlmRef [ref]="'S.

Cohen, Folk devils and moral panics, London: Mac Gibbon and Kee, 1972'" [text]="'Stanley Cohen'"></idlmRef>. A group of people, Muslims, would come to be “depicted as a threat to the values [...] of a society”, but it is not the purpose of this study to define this. From 2001 onwards, Islam became a political matter, a journalistic preoccupation and a subject of debate.

    <div title>The “evils” of Islam</div>
    <div introduction>
        <p>
            Islam has been a newsworthy subject since 2001, but the reasons for putting issues involving the use of the word “Islam” on the agenda are various. Certainly the violence causing bloodshed across the MENA region play a part in the media's use of the term “Islam”. Nevertheless, we also note the term’s use in a French context around “social issues” placed on the agenda for political reasons (the veil, halal, pain au chocolat and so on). This study offers a view of the words that surround Islam, those used when we address this subject. They allow us to see the concerns and fears that are at work in this media coverage and to measure what <idlmRef [ref]="'R. Liogier, Le mythe de l\'islamisation, Essai sur une obsession collective, Editions du Seuil, 2012'" [text]="'Raphaël Liogier'"></idlmRef>&nbsp;terms an “atmosphere of collective paranoia”.

                    Once the terms that recur most in the French language are removed, counting the words that appear most frequently in the documents allows us to understand the reasons behind the media coverage of Islam. The United States’ interventions in the Middle East and the attacks made by organisations in the name of Islam appear to be the leading subjects in which the issue of Islam is addressed. In France, Islam is addressed in the debates on the wearing of the veil and national identity.

    <div title>The adjectives of Islam</div>
    <div introduction>
        <p>
          A subject, a verb, a complement. And as for the adjectives, come and see me. “The instruction is legendary” recalls <idlmRef [ref]="'H. Kaddour, Inventer sa phrase, Paris, Éditions Victoires,  coll. « Métier journaliste », 2007, 119 p.'" [text]="'Hédi Kaddour'"></idlmRef>. By describing it, an adjective implicitly gives a definition of the concept studied. It introduces subjectivity to journalistic writing and reveals the thought that is unwritten (if not unthought). Thus, used to avoid mix-ups and develop nuance, the use of modifying adjectives gives, in a mirror image, a particularly unpleasant definition of Islam, an object that seems well defined from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again we can see the turning point that was 11th September 2001 in the light of the explosion of the use of the modifiers of Islam by the press.

Though the events connected or attributed to Islam these past years may not go so far as to be reckless, the emotional charge of the adjectives used with the term Islam is clearly negative.

    <div subtitle>Conclusion</div>
    <div introduction>
        <p>
            Through its multiple angles of approach, this study provides a certain number of elements of analysis that allow the principle trends that characterise the treatment of Islam in the French written press through the 1997-2015 period to be objectively placed. At a time when the “Islam issue” remains a sensitive and divisive subject in the media, this new kind of insight reveals certain interpretive keys that allow retrospective analysis of the media’s handling of Islam in France.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, the 11th September 2001 attacks were a pivotal moment in the evolution of the media coverage of Islam by the French press. Though it is certain that the main explanatory factor lies in the claims made by its perpetrators, it is no less true that the events began a phase in which Islam – as religion, political ideology and marker of identity – plays a key role in the reading of the analysis of international events (attacks, conflicts in Arab Muslim countries, etc.), as well as national news coverage (secularism, national identity and so on).
        </p>
        <p>
            Indeed, the chronological and quantitative insights throw up numerous correlations between the news from the Arab Muslim world (conflicts, elections, uprisings) and the use of the term “Islam”. From this point of view, the occurrences of the term “Islam” attempt to describe extremely diverse individuals, organisations and situations. It may be applied to violent political actors (Al-Qaeda, IS), conflict situations (civil wars in Iraq and Syria), political regimes (Iran, Saudi Arabia) and even the particular dynamics within Muslim-majority countries (Arab uprisings, “religious divisions”).
        </p>
        <p>
            Equally, when it comes to national news, the occurrences of the term “Islam” are subject to similar and sometimes even simultaneous fluctuations. Here, too, the impact of the 11th September 2001 on the media coverage of Islam in the national news is indisputable. The semantic tendencies observed in the international news permeate the national news relating to Islam. Although numerous, often controversial, episodes were presented as social issues (secularism, republican values, national identity, banlieues, etc.), an empirical and quantitative reading reveals the centrality of Islam to the content and handling of these subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the recurrence of terms, nouns and adjectives associated with Islam in the written press allows us to observe certain evolutions regarding the nature of the debates and analyses that surround the subject. In the period that followed the 11th of September 2001, it appeared, effectively, that the Islam described was only rarely the religion in its conventional sense. “Islam” instead referred to a plethora of actors, organisations, ideological, political and geopolitical currents, to the characterising dynamics in Arab Muslim countries, and individuals of Muslim faith in France.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there two major trends flow that stand out in this study. On the one hand, the international news imparted by the media studied increasingly included the religious factor, which, in fact, sometimes became the interpretative key in which certain events were read. Though it is clear that numerous dynamics and mutations in the Middle East and North Africa bring Muslim actors into play, viewing them only through the religious prism is insufficient to account for events whose challenges are multiple and often interdependent.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the national news coverage of Islam is characterised by a growing recourse to terminology that originally belonged to the international news. For example, the terms “fondamentaliste”, “rigoriste” and “salafiste” – recurrent in the international news – are used during the same periods (see above) in the coverage of national news (the veil issue, Islam in the banlieues, etc.). It is all as if the communicating vessels were established on semantic and ideological levels in the reading of the national and international news when it comes to Islam. The links between these two types of news would benefit from more in-depth exploration in order to better determine the construction of media discourses relating to Islam and the different processes of placing the “Muslim problem” on the agenda and building an issue around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, though the present study is unable to affirm that the press studied here contributes to the propagation of Islamophobia, the inverse would seem to be true: that we can discount the hypothesis of preferential media treatment of Islam; a deeper analysis of the documents would enrich the knowledge of the processes of placing it on the agenda and of the decisive factors driving it there.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a more general way, an advanced exploitation of the data generated by Skoli would make it possible to provide crucial contributions on the multiple characteristics of the media treatment of Islam in the French press. An in-depth analysis would allow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The events and debates of this period to be taken into account in a more global way, which could explain the fluctuations that the subject of “Islam” undergoes in the French media landscape (event causalities-Islam).</li>
            <li>The similarities and differences – qualitative and quantitative – could be highlighted between Le Monde, Le Figaro and Libération in their treatment of Islam at national and international levels.</li>
            <li>To move on to a lexical and discursive analysis of the documents containing the terms “Islam” and “Muslim” in various periods for the purposes of examining the multiple frameworks and interpretative keys through which Islam is discussed.</li>
            <li>To precisely measure the purpose of this media coverage, according to which Islam is treated either as a doctrinal and “ideological” corpus or as an essential determinant of the action of its followers – Muslims.</li>
            <li>To analyse the behaviour, in the documents, of the terms that have constructed the media imaginary around Islam. So the analysis of the occurrences of the terms “women”, “veil”, “secularism”, “Islamophobia”, the co-occurrence of the terms “French Islam” and “moderate Islam”, and even the study of the links and the symbolic loads that they carry would enable a sociological view that deconstructs the media’s language and the <idlmRef ref="P. Champagne, La Construction médiatique des “malaises sociaux”, Actes de la Recherche en Sciences Sociales, vol 90, 1991, p°64-76'" text="“borrowed speech”"></idlmRef>&nbsp; that results from it in the subjects.</li>
            <li>To measure the effects of journalistic encoding or framing and the context of the speech and the characteristics of the speakers on the model of the work carried out by Jérôme Berthaut as part of his <idlmRef ref="Jerôme Berthaut, La Banlieue du « 20 heure ». Ethnographie de la production d’un lieu commun journalistique, Agone, coll. « L’ordre des choses », 2013." text="study of the banlieue"></idlmRef>.</li>
            <li>To dissect the media’s handling of the initiatives proposing or attempting to halt the symbolic discrediting of Islam (associations, lobbies, media, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
